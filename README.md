Game
----

The object of the game is for each Team to get all of their Player's Pegs from their Home to their Castle.
To do this Players use the Cards in their Hand to move about the Board.
Depending on the Rule Set, Players are only allowed to move their Pegs until all are in the Castle.
Players are delt 5 cards (depending on Rule Set) and Players turns happen in a clockwise fashion.
Turns are as follows
    draw a card at the start of a turn, 
    play a card to your discard pile,
    move a Peg accourding to card value,
    and end their turn.
Players MUST play any playable non-Joker card (even is the move is not a benificial move).
If a Player does not have a Move then they must Discard (sometimes called "Counting").
After a Player has Discarded they may Draw a new Card OR only after Counting a number of cards (depending on Rule Set) they can move a Peg out of Home.
A Player is NEVER forced to play a Joker.

Movement
--------

All Pegs start in their Player's Home Area. 
Pegs move in a Clockwise fashion. 
Pegs may only move into their Player's Home or Castle.
Upon reaching their Castle, a Player moving the Peg may choose to enter the Castle or not.
A Peg can never move over or occupy the same space as another Peg from the Same Player.
A Peg can move over or land on a Peg from another Player. 
Landing on Opponent Player's Peg sends that Peg Back to Home.
Landing on a teammate's Peg sends that to space in front of the teammate's Castle (this move is not a valid option if the teammate's Peg cannot move into that space).

Playing a Joker allows players to move any Peg to any Playable space (Main Track).

Players may Move a Peg out of their Home by playing an Ace, King, Queen, Jack or Joker. (come out space)
Playing a 2,3,4,5,6 allows the player to move one of their Peg on the Main Track Forward by the Face Value of the Card.
Playing a 7 allows the player to move 2 of their Pegs Foward a total of 7 spaces (is the Player only has one Moveable Peg, they move that Peg 7 spaces forward).
Playing an 8 allows the player to move one of their Pegs 8 spaces Backwards.
Playing a 9 allows the player to move 2 of their Pegs, One Forward and One Backwards for a total of 9 spaces.
